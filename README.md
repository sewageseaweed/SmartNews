### Smart news is a chrome extension with a purpose to provide users with reliable sources of information. 

***This project is currently in hiatus.***

Current Accomplishments: Scraping websites for keywords to help determine if that site is reliable to not. Depending on the words it detects, the program will be able to determine the bias the site holds (i.e. a negative stand point or positive one regarding an event).

Current Difficulties: 
1) Grabbing URL links and feeding them to the Python backend. It was previously working but has since broken.
2) Creating an appealing UI.
