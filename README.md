# smartnews
### Smart news is a chrome extension with a purpose to provide users with reliable sources of information. The mission of this program is to not become a crutch for people to rely on to help determine if a source is reliable or not, but instead, become a tool that will help educate others on how to find reliable new sources, and see the outlook of an event from different perspectives.

***This project is currently in hiatus.***

Current Accomplishments: 
1) Scraping websites for keywords to help determine if that site is reliable to not. Depending on the words it detects, the program will be able to determine the bias the site holds (i.e. a negative stand point or positive one regarding an event).
2) After displaying the information on the website, SmartNews will then recommend additional sites: some with a negative bias, some with a positive bias, and some that are neutral.

Current Difficulties: 
1) Grabbing URL links and feeding them to the Python backend. It was previously working but has since broken.
2) Creating an appealing UI.
3) Only works on websites, not pdf documents.
4) Curretnly, the websites the program return aren't always consistent and maybe present random ones.
5) Due to Google's encryption, we must use bing to find similar websites to the one scanned.
